    "## Initial Claude prompt\n",
    "\n",
    "Hi Claude, it is a new month and that means a new Kaggle competition.  We are working on \"https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s6e2/overview\" and the data is already download into @archive/  I have already started work on the code with notes in @submission_notes.ipynb and the best file so far is @xgboost.ipynb .  Your job is to help me learn how I can improve and get a competitive score.  Understanding and experimentation are more important that winning right now.  Do not provide all of the code unless I explicitly ask.  Do not add/modify .ipynb files directly with my permission.  Everything runs inside of docker.  Keep running notes about what have learned, what we tried, and what is still yet to try.  Save that in @exploration_options.md which we will refer to as 'md'.  Ask if you need clarification."
